# Context-Aware-RL-Control
Accompanying code for Control of Hall Thrusters using context-aware reinforcement learning

### How to run the code
Activate the virutal environment to maintain dependencies. \
I know, I know, I should create a package with pip ... I will do this once I have a working code.
  
    source {PATH_TO_Context-Aware-RL-Control}/CARLC/bin/activate
    
 Run any script as you would in python + linux
 
    python3 {PATH_TO_Context-Aware-RL-Control}/src/{filename}.py
